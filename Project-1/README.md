## Analysis

1. Which program is fastest? Is it always the fastest?
2. Which program is slowest? Is it always the slowest?
3. Was there a trend in program execution time based on the size of data in each `Node`? If so, what, and why?
4. Was there a trend in program execution time based on the length of the block chain?
5. Consider heap breaks, what's noticeable? Does increasing the stack size affect the heap? Speculate on any similarities and differences in programs?
6. Considering either the **malloc.cpp** or **alloca.cpp** versions of the program, generate a diagram showing two `Node`s. Include in the diagram
    - the relationship of the `head`, `tail`, and `Node` `next` pointers.
    - show the size (in bytes) and structure of a `Node` that allocated six bytes of data
    - include the `bytes` pointer, and indicate using an arrow which byte in the allocated memory it points to.
7. There's an overhead to allocating memory, initializing it, and eventually processing (in our case, hashing it). For each program, were any of these tasks the same? Which one(s) were different?
8. As the size of data in a `Node` increases, does the significance of allocating the node increase or decrease?
